# Strings

[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/954334279/dd2abfbdd7#t=308)

A string is a sequence of characters (letters).
* Using "double quotes"
* Or 'single quotes'

A string is a type of **data structure**

```python

my_name = "Becks"
print(my_name)

````

A string has a number of characters inside it in a particular order.

This will access the first character.

```python
note = "The Most Perfect Crab"
print(note[0])
````

In coding we count form the zero - 'T' is the zeroth character.

And the last character: 

```python
print(note[-1])
````

## Get A Slice of the String

```python
print(note[0:3])
````

## Count the String

This uses a function pre-loaded into Python called `len`

```python
length = len("Mooji Michael Anthony!")
print(f"The string is {length} characters long")
````
