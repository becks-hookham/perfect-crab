#concatenation


🤝🏽 This means joining together.

We can join strings together in a few ways, here's one.

```python
my_string = "Ant" + "eater"
print(my_string)
```

_Note: you cannot concatonate a string and a number ("Forty) + 2). To make it do this, we need to explicitly convert the number to a string using the `str` function built into Python._

```python
my_string = "Forty" + str(2)
print(my_string)
```
