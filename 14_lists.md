# Lists

💻 A list is another type of **data structure**

💻 A list is essentially a sequence of items that can be of any type/

```python
my_favourite_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
my_friends = ["Victoria", "Mel", "Melanie", "Emma"]
````

⚠️ Notice the **[square brackets]** that tell Python it's a list
⚠️ It's really easy to forget the **commas**
